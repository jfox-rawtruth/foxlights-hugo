## How to connect to your lamp's built in Wi-Fi access point with an Android device.

### Step 1: Open Settings

Swipe down from the top of your screen to access the Quick Settings panel and tap the **gear icon**, or locate and open the **Settings** app in your app drawer.

### Step 2: Go to Wi-Fi Settings

In the **Settings** menu, tap on **Network & Internet** or **Connections**, depending on your device.

### Step 3: Access Wi-Fi Settings

Tap on **Wi-Fi** to view available networks.

### Step 4: Enable Wi-Fi

Ensure that the Wi-Fi toggle is set to **On**. This will display a list of available networks.

### Step 5: Select a Wi-Fi Network

Look for a network named _**WLED-AP**_. This is your lamp’s built-in access point.\
If you have multiple Fox Lights lamps, make sure only **one** is plugged in at a time during the initial setup.\
This avoids any confusion about which lamp you are connecting to — more on naming them later.

### Step 6: Enter the Password

Enter the password _**wled1234**_ and tap **Connect**.

### Step 7: You are Connected!

Once connected, the word "Connected" will appear under the network name, and a Wi-Fi icon will display in the status bar.\
You will be then see something like this:
