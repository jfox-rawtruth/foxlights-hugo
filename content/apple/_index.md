## How to connect to your lamp's built-in Wi-Fi access point with an iPhone or iPad

### Step 1: Open Settings

Unlock your iPhone or iPad and tap on the **Settings** app — it looks like a gray gear icon on your home screen.

### Step 2: Go to Wi-Fi Settings

In the **Settings** menu, tap on **Wi-Fi** near the top. This will open the Wi-Fi settings and automatically start scanning for nearby networks.

### Step 3: Enable Wi-Fi

If Wi-Fi is turned off, tap the toggle switch at the top of the screen to turn it **on**. A list of available networks will appear below.

### Step 4: Select a Wi-Fi Network

Look for a network named _**WLED-AP**_. This is your lamp’s built-in access point.\
If you have multiple Fox Lights lamps, make sure only **one** is plugged in at a time during the initial setup.\
This avoids any confusion about which lamp you are connecting to — more on naming them later.

### Step 5: Enter the Password

Tap on **WLED-AP**, then enter the password: _**wled1234**_ and tap **Join**.

### Step 6: You are Connected!

Once you’re connected, you’ll see a **checkmark** next to the WLED-AP network and a Wi-Fi icon in the top corner of the screen.\
Your device will then automatically open a pop-up or redirect to a page like this:

_Note: The layout may vary slightly depending on your iOS version, but the steps are essentially the same._
